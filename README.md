#Alternate
Write an alternating series of numbers

##Input
Input will only be one number `x`

##Output
Output will be two series, one going from `1` to `x`
and another going the opposite direction, merged together in a single line in an alternating manner.

For example, if **x** is **5**, the alternating series would be "1 **5** 2 **4** 3 **3** 4 **2** 5 **1**"
